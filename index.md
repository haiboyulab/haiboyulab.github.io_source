# Welcome to the Yu Lab!
{: .display-4}
<br>
We are part of the [School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience](https://www.uow.edu.au/science-medicine-health/schools-entities/school-of-chemistry-and-molecular-bioscience/) at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au). We are also affiliated with the [Molecular Horizons](https://www.uow.edu.au/research-and-innovation/our-research/research-institutes-and-facilities/molecular-horizons/) and the [Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute](https://www.ihmri.org.au/).

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.
