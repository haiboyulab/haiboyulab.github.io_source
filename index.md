# Welcome to the Yu Lab!
{: .display-4}
<br>
We are part of the [School of Chemistry and Molecular Bioscience](https://www.uow.edu.au/science-medicine-health/schools-entities/school-of-chemistry-and-molecular-bioscience/) at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au). We are also affiliated with the [Molecular Horizons](https://www.uow.edu.au/research-and-innovation/our-research/research-institutes-and-facilities/molecular-horizons/) and the [Illawarra Health and Medical Research Institute](https://www.ihmri.org.au/).

Research in our group is focused on developing and applying theoretical and computational tools to understand the structure-dynamics-function relationship in complex (bio)molecular and nanoscale systems. Complementary to experimental investigations, such studies can gain new insights at the atomic level into the underlying mechanism and provide necessary knowledge for molecular engineering and discovery of novel therapeutics.

We are located in the Molecular Horizons Building at the main campus of UOW.
